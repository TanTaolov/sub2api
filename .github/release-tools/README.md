# Release matrix

The release workflow builds the frontend once, then runs each configured Go target on its own Linux runner. `CGO_ENABLED=0` permits cross-compilation. The target matrix is read from `.goreleaser.yaml`, including its exclusions; every release is simplified and therefore selects Linux amd64 only.

Each build uses GoReleaser OSS in snapshot mode with the selected release version and one target. Archive naming, bundled files, Go flags and release templates remain in the existing GoReleaser configurations. Every archive is accompanied by its source commit, target, version and SHA256. The publishing job verifies the simplified matrix before building the image. The GitHub Release is created from the simplified GoReleaser config, which skips uploading archives and checksums. No Pro license is needed.

Go caches are isolated by target and refreshed on each source commit, with fallback to the preceding target cache. Save uses the original restore key, even if a build hook changes `go.sum`. Matrix jobs upload uniquely named artifacts. The publishing job extracts the regular Linux binary from the verified archive and restores its executable permission before constructing the Docker context.

`release-images.sh` pushes one `linux/amd64` image to `ghcr.io/<owner>/sub2api` and nothing else: no DockerHub login, no multi-arch manifest and no moving tag for a prerelease. QEMU is not set up because only the runner's native architecture is built.

All build jobs use the commit resolved by `prepare`, including a manual release's selected tag. Helper scripts come from the workflow revision and are passed as a run-local artifact, so older application tags do not need to contain the new scripts. The workflow serializes release runs to prevent simultaneous updates to moving image tags.

Helper checks:

```bash
python -m pip install -r .github/release-tools/requirements-release.txt
python -m unittest discover -s .github/release-tools -p 'test_release_matrix.py'
bash -n .github/release-tools/release-images.sh
```
